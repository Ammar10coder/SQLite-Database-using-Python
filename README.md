# SQLite-Database-using-Python
task 7
	1.	I created a SQLite database and designed a sales table to store product sales data including quantity, price, and date.
	2.	Using Python, I connected to the database and inserted sample data programmatically to simulate real sales transactions.
	3.	I wrote SQL queries within Python to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue for each product.
	4.	I used the pandas library to load SQL results into a DataFrame and display them in a readable format.
	5.	Finally, I visualized the sales summary using a bar chart created with matplotlib to show revenue or quantity comparisons between products.
